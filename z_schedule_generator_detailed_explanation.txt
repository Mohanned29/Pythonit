Scheduling Algorithm Steps:

1-Read Input Data: The main.py file reads sections from sections.json and rooms from rooms.json. It also reads course information from CSV files based on the program year and section.

2-Generate Schedule: When a request is received through the Flask app to generate a schedule for a particular section, the generate_schedule function is called with the section key.

3-Return Schedule: The generated schedule is then returned as a JSON response by the Flask app.



File-Reading Functions:
1-DataReader: This component reads JSON and CSV files to fetch the rooms, sections, and course information.



Web Application Interface:
1-The /api/schedule endpoint gives a prompt to specify a section for the schedule, while /api/select_schedule expects a section_key query parameter and returns the generated schedule for that section
